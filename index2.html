        <h2>WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT -</h2>
        <img src="web_development.jpg" alt="" width="250px">
        <P>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as
            web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management¹²³⁴⁵. Web development can be classified
            into two ways: Frontend Development and Backend Development¹.

            *Frontend Development* refers to the part of a website where the user interacts directly. It is also
            referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. The technologies used in frontend development include
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap¹.

            *Backend Development* is the server side of a website. It is the portion of software that does not come in
            direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data. The technologies used in backend
            development include PHP, Java, Python, and Node.js¹.

            If you are interested in learning more about web development, you can explore the roadmap of web development
            courses, tutorials, and projects on GeeksforGeeks¹.

        <H2>WHAT IS FRONTEND -</H2>
        <img src="c:\Users\piyu\Downloads\d1.png" alt="" width="250px">
        <p>Frontend Development is the part of a website that the user interacts with directly. It is also known as the
            ‘client side’ of the application. The main responsibility of a Frontend Developer is to create the user
            interface, which includes designing and developing the layout, look, and feel of the website. The
            technologies used in frontend development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS BACKEND</h2>
        <img src="c:\Users\piyu\Downloads\d2.png" alt="" width="250px">
        <P> Backend Development is the part of a website that the user does not interact with directly. It is also known
            as the ‘server side’ of the application. The main responsibility of a Backend Developer is to create and
            maintain the server-side of the website, which includes managing databases, APIs, and servers. The
            technologies used in backend development include PHP, Java, Python, and Node.js </P>

        <H2>WHAT IS API</H2>
        <img src="c:\Users\piyu\Downloads\d3.png" alt="" width="250px">
        <P>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols and tools that allow different
            software applications to communicate with each other 12345. An API can be accessed using different protocols
            such as HTTP, SOAP, or JSON.

            To understand the concept of an API, let’s take a real-life example. Imagine you are at a restaurant and you
            want to order food. You tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter takes your order to the kitchen. The
            kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter, who then brings it back to you. In this scenario, the
            waiter is the API, and the kitchen is the server that provides the service.

            APIs are used extensively in software development to implement various features by using an API call without
            writing complex codes for the same. A developer can create an API for an operating system, database system,
            hardware system, JavaScript file, or similar object-oriented files </P>

        <h3>WHAT IS HTML</h3>
        <img src="c:\Users\piyu\Downloads\d5.png" alt="" width="250px">
        <P>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML
            is used to describe the structure of a web page and its content. It consists of a series of elements that
            label pieces of content such as “this is a heading”, “this is a paragraph”, “this is a link”, etc</P>

        <H3>WHAT IS 'UTF-8'-</H3>
        <img src="c:\Users\piyu\Downloads\d4.jpeg" alt="">
        <P>UTF-8 is a character encoding standard that is used to represent text in a way that can be transmitted over
            the internet. It is a variable-length character encoding that defines all the characters needed for writing
            the majority of living languages in use on computers. UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML5 and the
            preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.

            UTF-8 is a superset of ASCII, which means that the first 128 characters of UTF-8 have the same binary values
            as ASCII, making ASCII text valid UTF-8. UTF-8 can be implemented by different character sets. The most
            commonly used encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16.
